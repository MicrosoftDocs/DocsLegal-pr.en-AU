# Windows 11 PCs performance details

This article details how we tested performance, battery life and application capabilities of a selection of Windows 11 PCs in comparison to a selection of Windows 10 PCs. Testing was concluded in December 2024.

## Performance Claims

#### Top Windows 11 PCs have up to 2.7 more hours of battery life than Windows 10 PCs

Based on local video playback test conducted by Microsoft in December 2024 comparing a selection of  Windows 10 PCs with Intel Core 6th, 8th and 10th generation processors and Windows 11 PCs with Intel Core 12th and 13th generation processors conducted in December 2024. Testing consisted of 90% battery discharge during video playback of a .mp4 file through the Windows Media Player application in 1080p at 24 FPS. All settings were default except screen brightness set to 150 nits with Auto-brightness disabled. Wi-Fi was connected to a network. Battery life varies significantly by device and with settings, usage and other factors. For more information, see [Test data for claims substantiation](#test-data-for-claims-substantiation).

#### Windows 11 PCs are up to 2.3x faster than Windows 10 PCs

Based on testing performed by Microsoft in December 2024 using Geekbench 6 Multi-core score comparing a selection of Windows 10 PCs with Intel Core 6th, 8th and 10th generation processors and Windows 11 PCs with Intel Core 12th and 13th generation processors. Performance will vary significantly by device and with settings, usage and other factors.

#### Windows 11 PCs offer up to 3.2x faster web browsing than Windows 10 PCs

Based on testing performed by Microsoft in December 2024 using Speedometer with Microsoft Edge browser versions 130.x and 131.x comparing a selection of Windows 10 PCs with Intel Core 6th, 8th and 10th generation processors and Windows 11 PCs with Intel Core 12th and 13th generation processors. Performance will vary significantly by device, browser and with settings, usage and other factors.

#### Windows 11 PCs offer up to 2x faster Microsoft Office productivity than Windows 10 PCs

Based on testing performed by Microsoft in December 2024 using Procyon Office benchmark comparing a selection of Windows 10 PCs with Intel Core 6th, 8th and 10th generation processors and Windows 11 PCs with Intel Core 12th and 13th generation processors. Performance will vary significantly by device and with settings, usage and other factors.

## Test data for claims substantiation

To develop the claims mentioned above, we tested 10 Windows 11 devices with 12th and 13th generation Intel processors and 10 Windows 10 devices with 6th, 8th, 10th and 11th generation Intel processors from multiple OEMs. The claims are based on a 95% confidence interval for both sets (Windows 11 and Windows 10) across multiple tests. For each set, we calculated the average minus two times the standard deviation to account for any outliers in the dataset.
